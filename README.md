The property price strongly depends on:
1. displacement from closest TTC subway stations (transportation score)
2. district (mean income of that district is a good reference whether that is prime region or not)
3. sqft
4. number of parking
5. number of bedroom
6. number of bathroom
7. Bloor Denforth Line (Line 2)

It coincides to why people always says "LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!"
